* Update commons-betwixt to 0.61-dev and replace .betwixt files with a multi-mapping
* Remove DDL subpackage and jelly-dependency which is not used anymore anyway
* Separate generation of generation of alter statements for an existing databases from the reading
  of the model from the existing database to allow for alter statement generation with two
  database models without having to connect to the database and thus allow for testing the
  alter statement generation without an actual live database
* Add unit tests for:

    - SQL generation (including alteration)
    - Roundtrip (database specific)
* Replace System.out/System.err writes with logging statements
* Extract interfaces from the model classes and inroduce a factory for creating the concrete model objects
* Make associations in the model (foreignkey, indices) stonger-typed by referencing the columns instead
  of using only their names
* Add functionality and ant tasks to insert/dump data into/from the database
* Add integration with DbUnit to allow DbUnit to use the schema and data files
