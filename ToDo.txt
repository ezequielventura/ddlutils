List of things to be done for the next version of DdlUtils:

* Add support for chosing the character set (ASCII, UNICODE) if the database supports it
  (perhaps a more generic configuration mechanism for overriding defaults)
* Add the ability to configure the datatype mapping (ant task, API)
* Extract interfaces from the model classes and inroduce a factory for creating the concrete model objects
* Add integration with DbUnit to allow DbUnit to use the schema and data files
* Add notion of jdbc types not directly supported by the database which are mapped to some large binary type,
  and add warnings when they are used (-> logging)
* It might be useful to add support for the ARRAY jdbc data type in the way that PostgreSQL does, by
  simply adding brackets to the base type instead of using the ARRAY literal as this does not define the base
  type at all
* It would be helpful if the platform impl check the length of user-supplied identifiers (table names,
  column names, fk names, index names) before any SQL is send to the database
* Add ability to specify the sorting direction of an index-column (ascending/descending) - this is at least supported in Derby
* Rather than dropping the indices/foreign keys that are at the current table, it would be better to simply drop any
  of the constraints/triggers connected to a table (if that is possible)
* Add support for:
  - One$DB (http://www.daffodildb.com/one-dollar-db.html)
  - H2 (http://www.h2database.com)
  - SQLite
  - Caché
  - Ingres
